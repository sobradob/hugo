## A very short introduction

Adventurous Cambridge graduate living the life of a tiring digital nomad. I am working towards a Masters in Statistics and Methodology at [Utrecht University](http://www.uu.nl/masters/en/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences). Currently in Singapore on an exchange semester.

Experience working for a bank in Geneva, a private equity advisory firm in London, an agrotech [startup](http://smartvineyard.com/) in Budapest and an [online venture builder](https://www.rocket-internet.com/) in Rangoon. Currently building an online venture servicing [Cuba](http://www.micubapura.com/). 

I am interested in how cutting edge technology and science can bypass development stages in the developing world. I am also excited by psychology, politics and statistics.

I enjoy travelling, reading and good company. Sometimes I dabble in coding and writing.
